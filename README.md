## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Using GitHub Repository:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mattermost": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/cockroach-eater/mm-mcp.git",
        "mm-mcp",
        "--url",
        "https://your-mattermost-instance.com",
        "--token",
        "your_personal_access_token"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using Login/Password Authentication:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mattermost": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/cockroach-eater/mm-mcp.git",
        "mm-mcp",

        "your_password"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using GitHub Release (after v0.1.0 is released):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mattermost": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "https://github.com/cockroach-eater/mm-mcp/releases/latest/download/mm_mcp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl",
        "mm-mcp",
        "--url",
        "https://your-mattermost-instance.com",
        "--token",

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run in development mode with MCP Inspector
uv run mcp dev src/mm_mcp/server.py

# Or use the MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run src/mm_mcp/server.py
```

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools:

- **get_teams**: Get all teams the authenticated user is a member of
- **get_channels**: Get all channels in a specific team
- **get_posts**: Get recent posts from a channel
- **send_message**: Send a message to a channel
- **search_messages**: Search for messages in a team
- **get_channel_by_name**: Get a channel by its name in a team
- **get_user_info**: Get information about a user

## Example Interactions

Once configured with Claude, you can interact with Mattermost naturally:

```
You: "Show me the recent messages in the #general channel"
Claude: [Uses get_teams, get_channel_by_name, and get_posts to fetch and display messages]

You: "Send a message to #engineering saying 'Deployment complete'"
Claude: [Uses get_channel_by_name and send_message to post the message]

You: "Search for messages about 'bug fix' in the development team"
Claude: [Uses search_messages to find relevant messages]
```

## Obtaining a Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your Mattermost instance
2. Go to **Profile ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Give it a description and click **Save**
5. Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)
6. Use this token in your `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` environment variable
